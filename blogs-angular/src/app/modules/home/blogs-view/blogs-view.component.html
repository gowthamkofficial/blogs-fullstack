        JavaScript is known for its flexibility, and one of the concepts that
        showcases this power is the closure. Though it may sound complex, a
        closure is simply the ability of a function to access variables from its
        outer scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
        Closures are especially useful because they allow for data privacy.
        Developers often use them to create variables that are hidden from the
        outside world but can still be manipulated internally. This is useful in
        situations where you want to store and update a value without exposing
        it directly. For example, closures are used in many JavaScript libraries
        and frameworks to manage state, build private methods, or write more
        modular code. They also play a key role in event handling and callback
        functions, especially in asynchronous operations. In everyday
        development, understanding closures can help improve the way you
        structure your code. It can lead to cleaner, more efficient applications
        and reduce the chances of bugs caused by unintended variable access.
        Though closures might take some time to fully understand, they are a
        powerful tool in the JavaScript language that every developer should
        take the time to learn and master. JavaScript is known for its
